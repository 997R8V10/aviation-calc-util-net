# Aviation Calc Util NET

This is a .NET Wrapper for the native aviation-calc-util library. This wrapper uses P/Invoke to interop between .NET and native C++ code.
The wrapper is built on the .NET Standard 2.0 framework and is therefore compatible with .NET Framework and .NET Core projects.

- **[Aviation Calc Util](https://gitlab.com/vatsim-tools/aviation-calc-util)**
